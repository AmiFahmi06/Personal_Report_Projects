# Clown Fish and Blue Tang Fish Species Classification using Color Moment Feature:  
Image vision can be used in the sky, on the ground, and underwater. This research proposed a fish species classification technique using the colour moment feature and a K-NN classifier. 
The colour moment is based on the probability distribution categorized as the mean, standard deviation, and lack of symmetry in probabilistic distribution (skewness) from the RGB colour model of the images. 
The dataset collected from Google image search contains 15 clown fish and 15 blue tang fish images. Then, 30 input images are cropped and resized before extracting each colour moment feature, based on the RGB model. 
The extracted features were stored, and the classification process was performed using a K-NN classifier. The accuracy achieved on the training data was 90.48% and 89% was achieved on the testing data.
